## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Jesica: Clear commuincation and transperancy of where each team memeber is at via Slack or meeting up outside of classroom hours. Attend Office hours for extra help when stuck in a wave.
Xi: Clear communication via slack/github/zoom

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Coding together for the first 2 waves so we can both be on the same page. Once we have a throught plan we can split the work up wether thats splitting 1 wave or all the waves together. 

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Jesica: Working together and explaining our work to each other as we move through each wave. Not leave one team member behind. Asking questions to each other first before reaching out in study-hall.
Xi: Learning through explaining things to each other, it would deepen my understanding for abstract concepts

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Jesica: Always open to constructive feedback via zoom instead of Slack. If I seem to be off trailing then let me know to spare time wasted.
Xi: I am open to anything any style, I am fine with pointing out any errors I’ve made. I appreciate feedbacks as a way to grow

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Jesica: I would like to work on explaining code better to make sure my partner understand where I cam coming from or how did i get to the solution. 
Xi: Communication and explanation

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
